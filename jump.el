;;; jump.el --- build functions for contextually jumping between files

;;; Components

;; - defjump (define functions which call jump-from and jump-to, and
;;   pass the required arguments between them)
;;   
;; - jump-from (takes either a string, a function, or t and
;;   returns the pieces to be passed to the jump-to function)
;; 
;; - jump-to (takes a string, or a function and the pieces passed from
;;   the jump-to function and opens or creates the related buffer)
;;

;;; things to keep

;; - the idea of having a "root" (string or function)
;; - the ability to subsume ffip
;; - the bulk of rinari-jump "maybe with the addition of documentation
;;   string to rule sets"

;;; TODO:

;; - regexp for method

;;; Code:
(require 'which-func)
(require 'findr)
;; (require 'inflections) ;; TODO try plural/singular versions by default

MAKE `find-file' will be used to open the path.
